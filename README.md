# Data Processing II Project 

**Speech Recognition with CNNs**

An attempt at building a simple speech file classifier with Tensorflow and Apache Spark for our Data Processing II class.
We recommend cloning this repo directly if you want to run any of our code

## Libraries

Please make sure to have the following libraries installed before running our code:

* Tensorflow
* TensorflowOnSpark
* PySpark
* Findspark
* Librosa
* SoundFile
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* TQDM

## Data

Follow the following steps to properly set up the data for our project:

1. Download the Speech Commands Dataset v0.01 [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge/data)
2. Create a directory called **data** in the main directory of this repository
3. Unpack the **train.zip** archive into the newly created **data** directory
